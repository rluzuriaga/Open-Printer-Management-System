## How can I help?
If you are a developer with Python/Django or front-end experience and would like to help, go ahead and fork the repository and make a pull request. <br />
I am not a front-end developer, so I decided to use a simple Bootstrap template. If you would like to help by designing and implementing a better design for this project, please make a pull request or contact me using the contact form on [my website.](https://rodrigoluzuriaga.com/#contact)

If you find an issue or have any ideas for more things to implement, you can create an issue and I will take a look at it. Your issue/request may have already been posted so take a look at the issues already created first.
